Django URL rules:

- All defined paths end with a trailing slash "/" (APPEND_SLASH=True).
  Example: /post/
 
- If the URL has path parameters, the slash comes AFTER the last parameter.
  Example: /posts/5/

- Query parameters (after "?") are NOT part of the path.
  The trailing slash must appear BEFORE the "?".
  Example: /posts/5/?page=2
  Example: /posts/?page=2

- Don't put a slash after query parameters.
  Wrong: /posts/5/?page=2/
  Correct: /posts/5/?page=2
  Wrong: /posts/?page=2/
  Correct: /posts/?page=2
